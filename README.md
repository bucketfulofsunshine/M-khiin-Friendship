# M'Khiin-Friendship
This mod introduces a short, but hopefully meaningful, friendship path with M'Khiin during Siege of Dragonspear. It includes five friendship talks, additional conversations responding to key story moments, and expanded interjections when appropriate.

## FAQ

### Q: Why does M'Khiin seem out of character?

A: Players have their own interpretations of canon characters. While I think she remains in-character, you may feel differently. I also don't claim to perfectly replicate her speech. If you have any suggestions for improvements, I'd be delighted to hear them / implement them (with thanks and credit). 

### Q: Any plans for TRA-ifying?

A: Not currently. However, if someone is interested in translating, feel free to reach out. 

### Q: The flesh is weak!

A: Even in death I serve the Omnissiah! :3
